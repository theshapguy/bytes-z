# Shap's Bytes
=========

This is my blog at [theshapguy.com](https://theshapguy.com/). Drafts are included in this `drafts` branch.

TIL's are in a different subfolder, the build script copies them into the posts folder and builds them so that they are shown in the blog index.

Ported from Hugo to Zola.
