## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I specialize in leveraging a diverse skill set spanning **frontend, backend, and database technologies** to bring digital projects to fruition. My primary interests are developing with Elixir, Phoenix w/ Liveview, and VueJS along with using PostgreSQL as a database of choice.

I also have previously have dabbled with Flutter, and frequently use [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) while developing my own projects for UI development.

Take a moment to explore my blog and my passion for code.

This site is built using [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) with [serene](https://github.com/isunjn/serene) theme, a fast, lightweight static site generator written in Rust.
