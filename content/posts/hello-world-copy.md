This is my new blog [theshapguy.com](https://theshapguy.com). I recently moved this data to blog to `Zola` from `Hugo`.

Firstly, a bit of background, I have been learning  to program for **two years** and done nothing much with it. Meaning, I have had no productivity with programming - **ABSOLUTE ZERO!** Every time I start a project, I manage to somehow stuff it inside my archive folder. And this year is going to change.


I will be creating a mini project every two week, and in a like manner, a bigger project every month this year. I'll be creating approximately 20-25 micro projects along with twelve mini projects this year. Above all, every project (BIG || small) needs to be a posted in this blog.


Not to mention, with is blog, I want to make myself more **liable** when I'm creating projects. To emphasize, I'm aiming for most of my projects to be MVP. Trying to be a perfectionist has held me back. I don't want **"perfectionism to boss me around"** this year.


My first step to *not let perfectionism boss me around*; this blog itself. If some links do
not work please allow me some time to fix it. Also I'll be making few changes to this blog
throughout the year. If there are any problems or want to contact me -
this twitter account [@theshapguy](http://twitter.com/theshapguy/) is best.

Now, lets go 2017!   ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

**UPDATE:**

I have not made a project each month however I have been successful releasing my first Android App. There are more to come by the end of this year. (- July 2017)
